# C# BOOTCAMP SECTION 501-601
**This repository is based on C# Bootcamp published by Murat YÃ¼cedaÄŸ on Youtube and is a continuation of the previous 301 & 401 repository. You can browse the details covered in each section from the bottom.**

## ðŸ“Œ Episode 22: Using Dapper with C# Part 1
We started the first part of the 501 module with Dapper. For this new topic, we added a new database and a product table via SQL, into which we entered 5 data in this table. Next we created a new project in Visual Studio and developed a simple form application in the classic format, as is a practical topic.

Since we will work with the Dapper topic using **Dtos**, we created two new folders in our project named **Dtos** and **Repositories**. In the Dtos folder, we added a class named **ResultProductDto**, where we wrote all the column headers in the product table we created as a properties. This way we can store the properties created in our table.

After this we added a new class called **CreateProductDto**, whichg we will use to copy the properties we created and place them in the **Dtos** folder. After pasting the copied properties, we removed Id property because it's auto-incremented during the addition process, so it won't be needed.

In the Repositories folder we created a new interface named **IProductRepository**. In this interface we'll work with asynchronous methods. You can see the generated code and its functions below. (You can review what is the asynchronous methods are and how they work in the notes section below.)

    public interface IProductRepository
    {
        Task<List<ResultProductDto>> GetAllProductAsync();
        Task CreateProductAsync(CreateProductDto createProductDto);
        Task UpdateProductAsync(UpdateProductDto updateProductDto);
        Task DeleteProductAsync(int id);
        Task GetByProductIdAsync(int id);
    }

Then we created a new class in Repositories folder named **ProductRepository**, inherited the **IProductRepository** interface in this class and implemented its methods. (By working with interfaces and classes, our goal is to maintain high code readability by making the UI side of the code an area where only methods are called, similar to the **N-Tier Architecture**.)

Finally we right-clicked on the project, selected **Manage Nuget Packages**, went to the **Browse** section in the window that opened, searched for **Dapper** in the search bar and installed the package.

**Notes:**

**Dtos: (Data Transfer Object)** This term refers to a lightweight structure used for transferring data. Unlike a model, DTO's allow us to focus only on the fields we need, rather than working with the entire data structure. They act as intermediaries for mapping our tables and classes in moduler structures and facilitating transitions between layers and folders.

**Async Programming:** In the C# programming language async enables an application to remain responsive while waiting for long-running operations to complete. It allows another task to run simultaneously. For example, imagine you are listing a data on the UI side of your project and the process takes about 20 seconds due to the large amount of data. Async programming is the while waiting for the data to load, you can also perform an update operation in background. In such cases, asynchronous programming allows multiple tasks to execute at the same time, improving efficiency and responsiveness.

**Task:** A structure in the C# programming language that represents the execution of a specific task or operation. Tasks are primarily used in **Async** programming. A task starts a process in the background and completes it while other processes can continue running. Some tasks return a value (as shown in the code at top), while others simply indicate the tasks completion.
